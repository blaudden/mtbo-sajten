O-Ringen is the world's largest orienteering competition. Here, during a wonderful summer week, you can enjoy orienteering in all its forms. There will be competitions in the forest, in the city, and even indoors for those who want. Regardless of whether you are an experienced elite rider or a beginner who wants to try orienteering for the first time, there is a class that suits you. The traditional 5-day competition class is the most popular, but there are also open classes where you can choose to participate for single or multiple days.

For MTBO (Mountain Bike Orienteering), there will be five wonderful races in different areas with great variation. Here you will find both areas with fewer trails and roads, but also MTB arenas with complex networks of trails and paths. This means that there will be opportunities to go at full speed between the controls, but of course you sometimes also have to adjust your speed and change pace to be able to find the controls without mistakes.

All MTBO stages are accessible by car from J√∂nk√∂ping where the camping is located. The first stage, a middle distance, takes place in an arena shared with the orienteering runners, providing a great start to the week where you can experience the large arena together with many other orienteers. The second stage is a forest sprint at the high-altitude IKHP clubhouse located northeast of J√∂nk√∂ping, where there is an MTB arena with plenty of trails and MTB tracks. Stage 3, which takes place in the outdoor recreation area at Hallby clubhouse west of the city, is also a middle distance, with a wide range of skiing, running, and cycling trails. Stage 4 is again to the south, in M√•nsarp, with an extended middle distance on varied terrain, from fast-paced forest roads to sandy trails. Finally, stage 5, also in M√•nsarp, is a long distance with a pursuit start in somewhat flatter terrain with route choice opportunities, where the overall winners of this year's O-Ringen will be decided.

## Terrain

We've all probably driven along the E4 north of J√∂nk√∂ping at some point, gazing into the beautiful pine forest and thinking, "I'd love to run or cycle here." There are talks about sandy trails, and that's of course one of the reasons for the beautiful forest and the road's location ‚Äì that it's partly sandy under the heather. But those in the know say it doesn't look like that everywhere, although this is definitely an area that will be worth experiencing, and now we finally have the chance to find out what it looks like inside the terrain!

Another interesting terrain feature is the two established MTB arenas at the IKHP clubhouse and Hallby clubhouse. These areas are well-known in MTB circles, and many skilled cyclists come from the area. Championships have been held here on several occasions, most recently the Youth MTB European Championships in the summer of 2024, as mentioned in the O-Ringen magazine. There will certainly be excellent orienteering in these areas.

All in all, an exciting variety of MTBO terrain awaits, where orienteering skills and bike control will be put to the test. It feels like each stage offers new conditions, so it will be important to read the map carefully and choose your route with care.

## Classes

You can take part in O-Ringen in several different ways:

- **5-days MTBO classes:** Competition class where the total time of the four first stages are summed up and at the fifth stage there is a chase start where the first over the finish line is the total winner. This is the classic competition format and still the most popular. The start times are drawn and assigned in advance, you choose a class according to your age.
- **Stage start:** Open classes where you choose a course suitable to your own ability and experience. You select your own starttime at the start. Compete against your friends by ‚Äútagging‚Äù them in the time taking system. The open classes are for those who only want to bike on some of the stages or would like the freedom of selecting a different course every day.
