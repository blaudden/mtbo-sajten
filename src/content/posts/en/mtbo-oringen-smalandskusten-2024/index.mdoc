O-Ringen is the world's largest orienteering competition and more than 20.000 orienteers
from all over the world are expected to attend. The 5-days competition class is the most
popular but there are also open classes available each day. The mountain bike orienteering (MTBO) concept is well integrated with the rest of O-Ringen competitions and offers a familiar experience regardless of wheter you compete by foot or bike.

The first two days of competitions will be held from the arena in Blomsterm√•la which is located 40km south of Oskarshamn. The other three days are held in close vicinity of Oskarshamn, this makes it possible for those staying at the camping or in town to bike to those stages. During stage 4 and 5 the MTBO arena will be located close to the runners arena, thus making it easy to socialize with your orienteering friends, clubmates and family regardless of whether you choose to run or bike your course.

## Terrain
Based on the description and pictures in the [O-Ringen Magazine](#o-ringen-magazine) the baltic ocean coast offers magnificent beautiful forrests with path and track networks well suited for MTBO. More sparse network for the long distance and detailed for the sprint will be a perfect mix. Several of the forrests are used for regular mountain biking with trails maintained by the local MTB clubs.

## Classes
You can take part in O-Ringen in several different ways:
* **5-days MTBO classes:**
Competition class where the total time of the four first stages are summed up
and at the fifth stage there is a chase start where the first over the finish line
is the total winner. This is the classic competition format and still the most
popular. The start times are drawn and assigned in advance, you choose a
class according to your age.
* **Stage start:**
Open classes where you choose a course suitable to your own ability and
experience. You select your own starttime at the start. Compete against your friends by
‚Äútagging‚Äù them in the time taking system. The open classes are for those who only want to bike on some of the stages or would like the freedom of selecting a different course every day.
